          <div class="milestone-title">The Bundi Cafe</div>
          <div class="milestone-desc">Too many french fries. Zero eye contact. I kept saying "aur batao" because I
            couldn't think of anything else. My first time ever meeting a girl alone — and I was a mess. But somehow you
            stayed.</div>

          <div class="milestone-title">The Bangalore Texts</div>
          <div class="milestone-desc">I went back to Bangalore, but you stayed on my screen. Mostly texting, getting to
            know each other one message at a time. You didn't tell me much about yourself yet — but I wanted to know
            everything.</div>

          <div class="milestone-desc">Our first real date. Aluwaliya Mall, Kota. I almost didn't buy that rose — thank
            god I did. You didn't even think it was a date until I handed it to you. When you smiled, my whole world
            shifted.</div>

          <div class="milestone-desc">Hours on the phone every single day. You finally started telling me about yourself
            — your life, your past, who you really are. And that's when I fell. Not for the idea of you, but for YOU.

            marathons, ice cream dates, watching you play GTA. The most ordinary days became my favorite memories.</div>
