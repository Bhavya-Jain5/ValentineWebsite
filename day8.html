        <div class="valentine-letter-opening">Dear Aastu,</div>

        <p>
          I've been trying to figure out how to write this, and the truth is — I'm not good at this stuff. You know
          that. I'm the guy who said "aur batao" fifteen times on our first meeting because I couldn't think of a single
          interesting thing to say.
        </p>

        <p>
          But here's what I can say.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before you, I only thought about myself. And not even in a good way — in a way that was going nowhere. I had
          no reason to wake up early, no reason to try harder, no one to be better for. I was just... existing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then you walked into that cafe in Bundi, and I ordered way too many french fries because I was so nervous I
          forgot how food works.
        </p>

        <p>
          And then June 24th happened. I almost didn't buy that rose. I keep thinking about that — how one small
          decision at a flower shop changed my entire life. You didn't even think it was a date until I handed it to
          you. But when you smiled... I think that's when it started.
        </p>

        <p>
          You didn't fall for me because I was smooth or confident or had it all figured out. I had none of that. You
          fell for me somewhere between the awkward silences and the 3 AM phone calls, and I still don't fully
          understand why. But I'm grateful every single day that you did.
        </p>

        <p>
          You know what I love most about us? We don't need anything special to be happy. Ice cream at Gomti. HIMYM on
          the laptop. Cooking together in that tiny kitchen. Beetroot all over our faces looking like laal tamatar. That
          one time we tried to kiss with face masks on and barely touched lips. Those are my favorite memories. Not
          because anything extraordinary happened — but because you were there.
        </p>

        <p>
          I know I'm not perfect. I know I mess up and sometimes I don't even realize it until it's almost too late.
          That scares me honestly. The idea that I could hurt you without meaning to — without even knowing I did. But
          I'm learning. You're teaching me, even when you don't know you're doing it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every day you choose me — every video call that starts with fifty kisses, every time you feed me before you
          eat, every skincare session where you take care of my face even though I'd never do it alone — you make my
          world a little brighter.
        </p>

        <p>
          You match my energy like no one ever has. You are the smartest, most confident, most beautiful person I know.
          You never judge me. You never judge anyone. When I talk to you for fifteen minutes, I forget every single
          thing that was stressing me out. You have actual magic and I need you to know that.
        </p>

        <p>
          In March, I'm coming to Jaipur. For real this time. No more Airbnbs, no more week-long visits, no more
          counting days until the next time I see you. I'm coming home — because home isn't a city, it's wherever you
          are.
        </p>

        <p>
          And I can't wait to cook with you again. God, I miss cooking with you.
        </p>

        <p>
          I can't wait to hug you whenever I want. No planning, no distance, no screens. Just us. Every day.
        </p>

        <p>
          You gave me Aavya. You gave me a reason to try. You gave me a future I actually want to live.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don't have all the fancy words, Aastu. But I have all the love. And it's yours. Every single bit of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, tomorrow, and every day after that.
        </p>
